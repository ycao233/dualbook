DualBooks
========

Two panels reading app on android tablet.  You can read two books at the same time, use the second panel to take notes, 
both text and image, or surf the web.  My motivation was to have an app that can display the same book in two translations
at the same time.    

First personal android project from 3 years ago, only builds with eclipse, didn't have tests, have tons of 
anti-pattern, but was my first project.  Holds a dear place in my heart. :)  I really wish one day I will have the time 
to clean it up.
